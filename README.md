# Spark-Learning
## Convert Notebook to Slides:
Make sure you have ipython and nbconvert set up.

In the directory with Mock Questions.ipynb run the following:


<code>ipython nbconvert Mock\ Questions.ipynb --to slides --post serve</code>

* Some of the slides are just facts or examples rather than practice questions
* ipython slides allow you to navigate left, right, up and down. The answers to each question is located one slide down from its question. New questions are to the left/right (if this is confusing, launch the slide deck with the command above and it'll be pretty clear...hopefully)
